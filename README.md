# TicTacToe

The Tic Tac Toe game from the Odin Project course.
This project focuses on the JS and hence the UI is simple.

Note
- Focus first on making a functioning game with simple UI and where you/me/user playes until someone wins or its a draw. Imagine you play against another person on the same screen and you take turns each round.
- This should be fiarly simple. However try and make use of the JS in Objects and Objects Constructors, and Factory Functions and the Module pattern lessons and apply things that you've learned there.
- When this is done push changes to github (of course along with the smaller changes in chronological order).

Extension
- Make the game so that we play against a AI. The AI can have different levels from easy, middle, hard and unbeatable. Hint: minmax algorithm.
