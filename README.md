# TicTacToe

The Tic Tac Toe game from the Odin Project course.
This project focuses on the JS and hence the UI is simple.


Timeline
- Focus first on making a functioning game with simple UI and where you/me/user playes until someone wins or its a draw. Imagine you play against another person on the same screen and you take turns each round.
- This should be fiarly simple. However try and make use of the JS in Objects and Objects Constructors, and Factory Functions and the Module pattern lessons and apply things that you've learned there.
- When this is done push changes to github (of course along with the smaller changes in chronological order).

Extension
- When this is done make a git branch and save it as TicTacToe-AI or similar. In this branch we will build the AI that we can play against.
- Make it so that we can play against the computer but also against a human if we want. Hence we need a play against computer or human button.
